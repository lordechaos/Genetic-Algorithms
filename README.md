# Function Optimization with Genetic Algorithms

Given a function f(x,y,z) find the values of x, y, and z such that f(x,y,z) = 0.
A genetic algorithm is used to achieve an answer close to or equal to zero.

Algorithm process:
. Randomly initialise the population.
. Calculate fitness.
. Select individuals for reproduction
. Perform crossover
. Perform mutation
. Select new population
. Repeat until convergence.
